#Explanation:

#The -v new_prefix="$sample_name" option passes the value of the sample_name variable from the Bash script to the new_prefix variable in awk.
#The -v count_start="$start_number" option passes the value of the start_number variable from the Bash script to the count_start variable in awk.
#The main code block inside single quotes (') is executed for each line of the input file.
#Explanation of the main code block:

#{ if (NR % 4 == 1) { ... } else { ... } } is a conditional statement that checks if the line number (NR) modulo 4 is equal to 1. This condition identifies the read header lines since they appear as the first line in every 4-line record.
#header = sprintf("%s.%d", new_prefix, (NR + 3) / 4 + count_start - 1) constructs the updated read header by combining the new_prefix (sample name) and the progressive number. (NR + 3) / 4 + count_start - 1 calculates the progressive number by dividing the line number by 4 (since each record has 4 lines) and adding count_start - 1 to adjust for the starting number.
#printf "@" header "_\n" prints the updated read header lines, with the old header completely removed. It uses printf instead of print to ensure that the line is printed without a trailing newline character.
#print is executed for all other lines (sequence, quality header, and quality values), and it simply prints those lines without any modification.
